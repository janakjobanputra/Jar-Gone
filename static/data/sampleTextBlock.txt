Multiple sections show a shave biopsy specimen with a relatively broad presence of melanocytes as disorderly arranged nests and solitary units, not only at the tips and side of the rete ridges, but also at the dermo-epidermal junction in the inter-rete epidermis. No upward scatter of solitary melanocytes seen, highlighted by a double immunostain for Melan-A/Ki67. The nests are variable in distance to each other, however, no confluence seen. A few nests of melanocytesare present in the dermis, defined by fibrotic stroma. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and melanophages are present. The melanocytes show enlarged nuclei with abundant amphophilic cytoplasm (spitzoid melanocytes). No mitotic figures or prominent nucleoli seen. Maturation towards the base with reduction of the cytoplasmic volume and nuclear sizes is observed. An immunostain for P16 shows no loss of P16 expression. A low proliferation index is seen.
